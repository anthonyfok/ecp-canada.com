# Archive of www.ecp-canada.com

This repository is an archive of the venerable www.ecp-canada.com website
 which was created in 2005 and contains records and photos of the
the Edmonton Chinese Philharmonica Association (ECPA) from 2003 to 2022.

The old website was mirrored using HTTrack, and, with some minor fixes
(e.g. Big5–to–UTF-8 conversion), is now served as GitHub Pages
at [archive.ecpa.ca](https://archive.ecpa.ca/).

Please visit [www.ecpa.ca](https://www.ecpa.ca/) for the new redesigned
ECPA website launched in April 2023.
