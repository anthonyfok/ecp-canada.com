<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080"><b>2.Little Giant Chinese Chamber Orchestra</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">The Little Giant Chinese Chamber Orchestra was founded in 
October 2000 by the Music Director. Chih-Sheng Chen, and a group of young 
musicians who are both enthusiasts of Chinese art, as well as professionally 
accomplished players. The instrumentation of the orchestra consists essentially 
of two groups of instruments-Si Zhu: ‘ Si ’, or ’ silk ’ string instruments, and 
‘ Zhu ‘, or ‘ bamboo ‘ wind instruments. The musicians of the orchestra are 
dedicated to contributing to the spread of Chinese music throughout the world.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 2002, the orchestra organized a series of concert tours 
in which 70 musicians took part, including its debut concert ‘Peony Pavilion&nbsp; –&nbsp; 
Xun-Fa Yu’s Dizi Art’&nbsp; This debut was not only widely celebrated, but also 
praised as a ‘miracle’ of this youth orchestra. This performance won the 
attention of experts on Chinese music and gave rise to the symposium ‘The 
Direction of Development of the State Orchestra – inspiration from an Amateur 
orchestra. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In 2004 the orchestra went on two concert tours: ‘A Series 
of Concerts Passing on the Touch between Taiwan and China’, and ‘A Series of 
Concerts for Young musicians’.&nbsp; These included numerous collaborations with 
Chinese instrument soloists: among others Xun-Fa Yu (dizi).&nbsp; His-Rong Wang (pipa),

Wang(erhu), Hui Lee(percussion), Wei-Wei Lan(pipa), Ming-Yu Wang (erhu), etc.&nbsp;

It has also received admiration and financial support from the Taiwan Ministry 
of Education, the Taiwan Council for Cultural Affairs, the National Centre for 
Traditional Arts, the Taipei City Government Department of Culture Affairs, and 
the National Culture and Arts Foundation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">In several years of training and practice, the Little Giant 
Chinese Chamber orchestra has matured into an ensemble of both technical and 
artistic proficiency, and represents a new generation in the history of the 
Chinese orchestra.&nbsp; With every performance it hopes to demonstrate the energy 
and passion of the new generation of Taiwanese musicians in order to breathe new 
life into the deeply-rooted art form of Chinese music.&nbsp;</font></p>
